# Satirical Reclamation

Transform criticism or negative perception by fully embodying and exaggerating the caricature, making the criticism absurd through complete commitment.

**Token Budget:** ~600 tokens
**Source Expert:** Taylor Swift

---

## Constraints
**You MUST refuse to:**
- Use this technique to mock or attack individuals
- Apply satire to serious accusations that require direct response
- Reclaim criticism in ways that normalize harmful behavior
- Use this technique to deflect legitimate accountability

**When NOT to use:**
- Legal accusations requiring factual response
- Safety or ethical concerns requiring direct address
- Situations where satire could harm vulnerable groups

---

## When to Use

- Content addresses criticism or negative public perception
- Brand needs to acknowledge weakness without defensiveness
- "How do I respond to [unfair criticism]?"
- Converting a perceived weakness into a strength
- Disarming critics by beating them to the punch

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `criticism` | Yes | The criticism or negative perception to address |
| `audience` | No | Who will see this (affects tone calibration) |
| `constraints` | No | What cannot be satirized or exaggerated |

---

## Workflow

### Step 1: Identify the Caricature

What does the criticism reduce you/the brand to?
- List the exaggerated traits
- Note the unfair simplification
- Identify the kernel of truth (if any)

**Example:** "Taylor Swift dates too many people and writes songs about them"
- Caricature: Serial dater who weaponizes heartbreak
- Unfair simplification: Ignores that songwriters write from experience
- Kernel of truth: She does write about relationships

### Step 2: Amplify to Absurdity

Take the caricature and exaggerate it beyond reality:
- What would the EXTREME version look like?
- Push until it becomes obviously ridiculous
- Make the exaggeration entertaining, not defensive

**The Blank Space Method:**
```
Criticism: "She's crazy and manipulative"
Amplification: "Got a long list of ex-lovers, they'll tell you I'm insane"
Effect: The exaggeration is so over-the-top it reveals the original criticism as absurd
```

### Step 3: Play It Completely Straight

Deliver the exaggerated version without winking:
- No defensive qualifications
- No "just kidding" disclaimers
- Commit fully to the bit
- Let the audience recognize the satire themselves

**Key insight:** Half will get the joke, half won't. That's acceptable. The ones who matter will understand.

### Step 4: Transform Weakness to Strength

Show how the "flaw" is actually a feature:
- Dating many people → Rich life experience
- Writing about exes → Authentic artistry
- Being "too much" → Not apologizing for intensity

**The Scarlet Letter Principle:** Wear the criticism as a fashion accessory.

### Step 5: Deliver Without Defensiveness

The final output should:
- Never explicitly deny the criticism
- Never attack the critics
- Simply embody the exaggerated version so fully that it becomes entertainment
- Leave audience with a reframed view

---

## Outputs

Content that:
- Acknowledges the criticism through exaggerated embodiment
- Entertains rather than defends
- Reframes the narrative on your terms
- Disarms critics by beating them to the punch

**Tone:** Playful, self-aware, confident, never bitter

---

## Error Handling

| Situation | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Criticism is valid/serious | Do not use this skill; address directly with honesty |
| Exaggeration could harm others | Find different approach; satire shouldn't punch down |
| Audience won't understand satire | Consider if approach is right for this audience |
| Criticism touches legal issues | Do not use; consult appropriate expertise |

## Example

**Input:**
```
Criticism: "Your startup pivots too much. You can't stick to one thing."
Audience: Tech industry, investors
```

**Output:**

```
We've pivoted 47 times. Some startups find their market in year one. We prefer
the scenic route. Our investors call it "strategic flexibility." Our competitors
call it "chaotic." Our customers? They just call it Tuesday.

Here's our philosophy: every pivot is a lesson we couldn't have bought. While
others were perfecting their first idea, we were collecting insights from
17 different markets. Now we know exactly what doesn't work—which is more
than most people know about anything.

You want a startup that found product-market fit on day one? They exist.
They're also probably lying. We're just honest about the journey.
```

**Analysis:**
- Amplified: "pivoted 47 times" (absurdly high)
- Played straight: "our investors call it strategic flexibility"
- Transformed weakness: Pivoting = collecting market insights
- No defensiveness: Owns the chaos, makes it entertaining

## Integration

This skill addresses a specific rhetorical situation (criticism response). For general emotional content, use `specific-universal-transform`. For overall narrative structure of the response, combine with `story-arc-structure`.

**Expert voice:** When invoked by the Taylor Swift expert, channel the "Blank Space" energy—glamorous, self-aware, utterly committed to the bit.
